# Hey :),

### I'm Dong Hang, currently doing a master degree of Software Architecture in Paris.

### I started learning programming by myself in June 2020.

### Though it's not a long time since then, I realize I've already made a lot of bad choices in learning. 

### I could have learned in a easier and faster way, also with less stress and less frustration.


::: warning Why I want to write this blog?

### Keep a track of my programming learning process and motivate myself to learn more smartly.

### Share my self-learning experience to people like me who find programming is intimidating and too much to learn.

### Do my self-reflections and retrospect.
